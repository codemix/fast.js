# fast.js


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codemix/fast.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/codemix/fast.js)

## Introduction
Fast.js is your solution for easily writing very fast JavaScript programs like web servers. This library contains a collection of small changes for several common built-in native JavaScript functions, which make writing fast JavaScript programs easier. These micro-optimizations are capable of making your programs considerably faster.  It includes fast replacements for several built-in native methods such as .forEach, .map, .reduce etc, as well as common utility methods such as .clone.  

> Note: fast.js is very young and in active development. The current version is optimised for V8 (chrome / node.js) and may not perform well in other JavaScript engines, so you may not want to use it in the browser at this point. Please read the [caveats section](#caveats) before using fast.js.

## Installation

Via [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/fast.js):
```
npm install --save fast.js
```

## Usage

```js
var fast = require('fast.js');
console.log(fast.map([1,2,3], function (a) { return a * a; }));
```

## How?

Thanks to advances in JavaScript engines such as V8 there is essentially no performance difference between native functions and their JavaScript equivalents, providing the developer is willing to go the extra mile to write very fast code. In fact, native functions often have to cover complicated edge cases from the ECMAScript specification, which put them at a performance disadvantage.

An example of such an edge case is sparse arrays and the `.map`, `.reduce` and `.forEach` functions:

```js
var arr = new Array(100); // a sparse array with 100 slots

arr[20] = 'Hello World';

function logIt (item) {
  console.log(item);
}

arr.forEach(logIt);

```

In the above example, the `logIt` function will be called only once, despite there being 100 slots in the array. This is because 99 of those slots are empty. To implement this behavior according to spec, the native `forEach` function must check whether each slot in the array has ever been assigned or not (a simple `null` or `undefined` check is not sufficient), and if so, the `logIt` function will be called.

However, almost no one actually uses this pattern - sparse arrays are very rare in the real world. But the native function must still perform this check, just in case. If we ignore the concept of sparse arrays completely, and pretend that they don't exist, we can write a JavaScript function which comfortably beats the native version:

```js
var fast = require('fast.js');

var arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

fast.forEach(arr, logIt); // faster than arr.forEach(logIt)
```


By optimising for the 99% use case, fast.js methods can be up to 5x faster than their native equivalents.

## Caveats

As mentioned above, fast.js does not conform 100% to the ECMAScript specification and is therefore not a drop in replacement 100% of the time. There are at least three scenarios where the behavior differs from the spec:

- Sparse arrays are not supported. A sparse array will be treated just like a normal array, with unpopulated slots containing `undefined` values. This means that iteration functions such as `.map()` and `.forEach()` will visit these empty slots, receiving `undefined` as an argument. This is in contrast to the native implementations where these unfilled slots will be skipped entirely by the iterators. In the real world, sparse arrays are very rare. This is evidenced by the very popular [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)'s lack of support.

- Functions created using `fast.bind()` and `fast.partial()` are not identical to functions created by the native `Function.prototype.bind()`, specifically:

    - The partial implementation creates functions that do not have immutable "poison pill" caller and arguments properties that throw a TypeError upon get, set, or deletion.

    - The partial implementation creates functions that have a prototype property. (Proper bound functions have none.)

    - The partial implementation creates bound functions whose length property does not agree with that mandated by ECMA-262: it creates functions with length 0, while a full implementation, depending on the length of the target function and the number of pre-specified arguments, may return a non-zero length.

    > See the documentation for `Function.prototype.bind()` on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Compatibility) for more details.


- The behavior of `fast.reduce()` differs from the native `Array.prototype.reduce()` in some important ways.

    - *Specifying* an `undefined` `initialValue` is the same as specifying no initial value at all. This differs from the spec which looks at the number of arguments specified. We just do a simple check for `undefined` which may lead to unexpected results in some circumstances - if you're relying on the normal behavior of reduce when an initial value is specified, make sure that that value is not `undefined`. You can usually use `null` as an alternative and `null` will not trigger this edge case.

    - A 4th argument is supported - `thisContext`, the context to bind the reducer function to. This is not present in the spec but is provided for convenience.


In practice, it's extremely unlikely that any of these caveats will have an impact on real world code. These constructs are extremely uncommon.

## Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks in node.js:

```
npm run bench
```

To run the benchmarks in SpiderMonkey, you must first download [js-shell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Introduction_to_the_JavaScript_shell).
If you're on linux, this can be done by running:

```
npm run install-sm
```

This will download the [latest nightly build](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/) of the js-shell binary and extract it to [ci/environments/sm](./ci/environments/sm). If you're on mac or windows, you should download the appropriate build for your platform and place the extracted files in that directory.

After js-shell has been downloaded, you can run the SpiderMonkey benchmarks by running:


```
npm run bench-sm
```

### Example benchmark output
